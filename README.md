# Artificial Intelligence in Mobile Applications of Augmented Reality

Beyond LLM offers an all-in-one toolkit for experimentation, evaluation, and deployment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, simplifying the process with automated integration, customizable evaluation metrics, and support for various Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to specific needs. SolARFramework is an open-source framework under Apache v2 licence making possible to easily create your own camera pose estimation solution to develop Augmented Reality applications. LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. Boden empowers you to create native mobile cross-platform applications from a single codebase. Kotlin is a concise multiplatform language. Android apps with GraalVM, Gluon Mobile, JavaFX, and Scala. Stanford CoreNLP provides a set of natural language analysis tools written in Java. Maid is a cross-platform Flutter app for interfacing with GGUF / llama.cpp models locally, and with Ollama and OpenAI models remotely. XR-Objects is an open-source prototype that anchors contextual interactions onto analog objects to not only convey information but also to initiate digital actions, such as querying LLMs for details or executing tasks. Creating an early form of Augmented Object Intelligence. The DeepReality Unity package is aimed at simplifying and streamlining the usage of machine learning models in conjunction with the AR functionality. VIAME is a computer vision application. The Compute Library is a collection of low-level machine learning functions. Apple's ARKit and Google’s ARCore use AI to enhance facial tracking, improving AR filters and immersive experiences. OpenARK is an open-source wearable augmented reality (AR) system. OpenCV Mobile is a minimalist build of the popular OpenCV library, specifically optimized for mobile and embedded platforms
